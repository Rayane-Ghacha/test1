## Overview

The provided Arduino code is designed to control a robot with the following features:

- **Motor Control**: Controls the speed and direction of the robot using an L298N motor driver.
- **Steering Mechanism**: Uses a servo motor for steering control.
- **Distance Sensing**: Utilizes four VL53L1X distance sensors for obstacle detection in all directions (front, back, left, right).
- **Encoder Feedback**: Reads encoder data to monitor motor speed and distance traveled.
- **Communication**: Exchanges data with a Raspberry Pi for higher-level processing and decision-making.
- **Buzzer Alerts**: Provides audible feedback for different robot states (start, stop, error).

## Functions Explanation

### Interrupt Service Routines (ISRs)

- **encoderISR_A()**: Increments the encoder count when a pulse is detected on Channel A.
- **encoderISR_B()**: Decrements the encoder count when a pulse is detected on Channel B (if using quadrature encoding).

### Encoder Functions

- **setupEncoder()**: Initializes the encoder pins and attaches the ISRs.
- **readEncoder()**: Returns the current encoder count.
- **resetEncoder()**: Resets the encoder count to zero.

### Motor Control Functions

- **driveDistanceSpeed(float distanceCM, int speedInput)**: Moves the robot a specified distance in centimeters at a given speed percentage (-100 to 100). It uses encoder feedback to determine when the desired distance has been traveled.
- **controlRobot(int speedInput, int steeringInput)**: Controls the robot's speed and steering based on inputs received (e.g., from the Raspberry Pi). Speed input ranges from -100 (full reverse) to 100 (full forward). Steering input ranges from -100 (full left) to 100 (full right).
- **StopMotors()**: Stops the motor by setting the control pins to LOW and speed to zero.
- **HoldMotors()**: Engages both motor control pins to HIGH to hold the motor position (dynamic braking).

### Sensor Setup and Reading Functions

- **setupSensors()**: Initializes the VL53L1X distance sensors by configuring their XSHUT pins and setting unique I2C addresses.
- **readAndPrintDistances()**: Reads distances from all sensors and prints them to the Serial monitor.

### Buzzer Functions

- **BuzzerRobotStart()**: Plays a startup sound when the robot is powered on or initialized.
- **BuzzerRobotEnd()**: Plays a shutdown sound when the robot operation ends.
- **BuzzerRobotError()**: Plays an error sound when an issue is detected (e.g., switch is off).
- **BuzzerRobotSpecial()**: Plays a special melody (optional use).

### Communication Functions

- **sendDataToPi()**: Sends sensor readings and motor speed data to the Raspberry Pi via Serial communication.
- **receiveDataFromPi()**: Receives control commands from the Raspberry Pi and parses them to control the robot.

### Utility Functions

- **isSwitchOn(int value)**: Determines if the switch is in the "on" position based on the analog reading.
- **act()**: Performs the main actions of sending data to and receiving commands from the Raspberry Pi.

## Setup and Initialization

1. **Serial Communication**: Begins Serial communication at 115200 baud rate for communication with the Raspberry Pi.
2. **I2C Communication**: Initializes the I2C bus for communication with the distance sensors.
3. **Pin Modes**: Sets the appropriate pin modes for motor control, buzzer, and switch.
4. **Servo Initialization**: Attaches the steering servo to the designated pin.
5. **Motor and Encoder Initialization**: Ensures motors are stopped and encoders are set up.
6. **Sensor Initialization**: Calls `setupSensors()` to initialize all distance sensors.
7. **Startup Sound**: Plays the startup sound using `BuzzerRobotStart()`.

---

## Main Loop Execution

The `loop()` function continuously performs the following steps:

1. **Switch State Check**: Reads the switch value to determine if the robot should operate.
2. **Operation Execution**:
   - If the switch is on (`isSwitchOn(switchValue)` returns `true`), it calls the `act()` function to handle communication and control.
   - If the switch is off, it stops the motors (`HoldMotors()`) and plays an error sound (`BuzzerRobotError()`).

- **Buzzer**: Positive pin connected to pin `8`, negative pin connected to ground.
- **Switch**: One side connected to analog pin `A0`, the other side connected to `5V`, with a pull-down resistor connected to ground if necessary.
- **Raspberry Pi**: Connected via Serial communication to the Arduino (ensure voltage levels are compatible or use a logic level converter).

## Troubleshooting

- **No Movement**: If the robot doesn't move, check motor connections and ensure the motor driver is properly connected.
- **Sensors Not Responding**: Verify the connections of the VL53L1X sensors and ensure their addresses are correctly set.
- **Buzzer Not Sounding**: Check the buzzer connections and ensure it is connected to the correct pin.
- **Serial Communication Issues**: Ensure the baud rate matches on both the Arduino and Raspberry Pi. Check connections.
- **Switch Not Working**: Verify the switch is correctly connected and functioning. Use a multimeter to test continuity.
