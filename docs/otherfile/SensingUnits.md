## Sensing units:
The distance sensors in the robot play a crucial role in enabling it to interact with its environment and avoid obstacles. In this robot, laser-based distance sensors are placed on four sides: front, back, and both sides. These sensors use laser technology to measure the distance to objects. They emit laser beams that reflect when they hit an obstacle, and by calculating the time it takes for the beam to return, the robot can accurately estimate the distance.

Having sensors on all four sides provides the robot with 360-degree coverage, giving it a comprehensive "view" of its surroundings. The front sensors detect obstacles in the robot’s path, preventing collisions as it moves forward. The rear sensors allow the robot to reverse safely without hitting any objects behind it. The side sensors, on both the left and right, enable the robot to detect obstacles during turns or maneuvers, ensuring smooth and precise movement even in complex environments.

The system integrates data from all these sensors to create a complete map of the surrounding environment. Using this information, the robot can make real-time decisions such as avoiding obstacles, selecting the optimal path, or stopping when approaching an unexpected object. These sensors also allow the robot to navigate through complicated routes without the need for direct human control, enhancing its autonomous navigation capabilities.

The sensors provide high accuracy thanks to laser technology, which allows reliable distance measurement even at relatively long ranges. This precision improves the robot’s responsiveness, making it capable of reacting quickly to changes in its environment—whether it’s avoiding an approaching person or maneuvering around a sudden obstacle in its path.
